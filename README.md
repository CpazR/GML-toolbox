# GML-toolbox
An open-source toolbox of useful, documented scripts, created and curated by the community.

Adding your own scripts:

Create a branch and give it a name fitting with what you're contributing.

IMPORTANT: PLACE ALL FUNCTIONS IN BRANCH IN THE "script-sources" FOLDER

IE: new-functions/ds-sorting-scripts OR new-functions/ds-scripts

Once finished, push your branch and create a pull request. Where if anything needs adjusting, you will be informed and asked to adjust accordingly.
Keep in mind, that having documentation on how the function(s) are to be used is highly recommended. Some of the bare requirements are below.

Style guide:
  -General Style:
    -Nothing special (TBD)
    
  -Documentation:
    -AT LEAST utilize the @funcction, @description, and @param tags 
    
  -For any other questions, see existing scripts for examples.
