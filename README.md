# GML-toolbox
> An open-source toolbox of useful, documented scripts, created and curated by the community.

Adding your own scripts:

Create a branch and give it a name fitting with what you're contributing.

IMPORTANT: PLACE ALL FUNCTIONS IN BRANCH IN THE "script-sources" FOLDER

IE: new-functions/ds-sorting-scripts OR new-functions/ds-scripts

Once finished, push your branch and create a pull request. Where if anything needs adjusting, you will be informed and asked to adjust accordingly.

Style guide:


    General Style:
  
    -Nothing special (TBD)
    
    
    Documentation:
  
    -AT LEAST utilize the @funcction, @description, and @param tags
    
    -For structs, be sure they're documented to some extent
      -If a property is intended to be private, be sure to have setters and getters for them, also denote this in the comment
        -might use functionless macros for readability later
        
  For any other questions, see existing scripts for examples.
